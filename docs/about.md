### üöÄ About the project

**MathNano AI** is your AI assistant for effortless math expression. It's a powerful Chrome Extension built to eliminate the frustration of writing complex math notation.

#### The Problem
Writing mathematical equations is a universal challenge. For students, it's a barrier to taking notes. For teachers, it's a time-sink when creating exercises. Even for seasoned STEM professionals, remembering the specific LaTeX syntax for every symbol (like \psi - œà or \zeta - Œ∂) is a constant friction point. A simple formula can take far too long to typeset correctly.

#### Our Solution
MathNano AI is a powerful, multi-modal AI assistant that lives directly in your browser. It's designed to be the ultimate co-pilot for anyone who works with math, from a high school student to a computer science undergraduate. It understands math the way you do‚Äîwhether you draw it, see it, say it, or just know its name.

The best part? It's our first-ever Chrome Extension, built using **Google's built-in AI API**. This allows MathNano AI to run **100% locally** on your machine. It's private, completely free, and even works offline.

#### Key Features
We focused on creating a seamless workflow with multiple, intuitive inputs and flexible outputs.

**Multi-Modal Input:**
* **‚úçÔ∏è Handwriting-to-LaTeX:** Draw your equation on our canvas, and our AI converts your handwriting directly into clean LaTeX code.
* **üì∏ Screenshot-to-LaTeX:** See a formula anywhere on your screen? Just capture it, and MathNano will instantly provide the code.
* **üó£Ô∏è Speech-to-LaTeX:** Simply say the names of symbols or formulas ("alpha plus beta equals gamma"), and watch the code appear in real-time.
* **üí¨ Chat-to-LaTeX:** Ask for a formula by name (e.g., "quadratic formula" or "Fourier transform"), and the AI will generate it for you.

**Instant Output & Customization:**
* **Live Preview:** Get an immediate, rendered preview of your math expression as you work.
* **Copy & Download:** Instantly copy the raw LaTeX code or download the rendered expression as an image.
* **Full Styling:** Customize the image output by changing the text color, background color (or making it transparent), font size, and padding.

### üöÄ What's Next: A Hybrid AI Strategy with Firebase & Gemini

MathNano AI's local-first, private approach is just the start. Our roadmap is focused on integrating Google's powerful cloud services to create a more robust and accessible hybrid experience, directly addressing the hackathon's challenge.

* **Cloud Sync & Cross-Device Support via Firebase**
    We will implement **Firebase Authentication** for secure login and use **Firestore** to allow users to save their math expressions to the cloud. This not only provides a valuable backup but is the essential first step to extending MathNano's reach from a Chrome Extension to mobile and other web-based platforms.

* **A True Hybrid AI Strategy with Gemini**
    Building on the Firebase foundation, we will implement a "hybrid AI" smart-switch. This system will leverage **Firebase AI Logic** to intelligently route requests: simple, fast conversions will remain on-device, while more complex tasks (or requests from users on less-powerful machines) will be sent to the **Gemini Developer API**. This ensures *all* users, including those on mobile, have access to high-quality LaTeX conversion, fulfilling the goal of extending our reach.

* **Gemini-Powered Math Solver**
    With the Gemini API integrated, our flagship feature will be a **Gemini-Powered Math Solver**. This will leverage the full power of Google's flagship model, **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, to ensure the highest possible accuracy. We will specifically utilize its **"Deep Think"** enhanced reasoning mode‚Äîthe same technology that has achieved gold-medal performance in mathematical Olympiads. Users will be able to capture *any* math problem, and our assistant won't just *write* the formula; it will provide a complete, step-by-step explanation, turning MathNano into an indispensable learning and teaching tool.
